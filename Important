Running the Environment
To run the sandbox environment:

Build the Docker Image:

Run the following command in the directory containing your Dockerfile:
bash
Copy code
docker build -t sandbox-env .
Run the Python Script:

Run the sandbox.py script with the path to the suspicious file you want to execute:
bash
Copy code
python3 sandbox.py /path/to/suspicious-file.exe
Optionally, use Docker Compose:

Build and run the containers using Docker Compose:
bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
Step 5: Logging Activity with Sysmon (Optional)
If you want to use Sysmon to log detailed system activity during the execution of the file inside the container:

Configure Sysmon:

Download and install Sysmon inside the container (already done in the Dockerfile).
You can set it up by copying a Sysmon configuration file and starting Sysmon when you launch the container.
Configure the Sysmon Start Command:

Modify the ENTRYPOINT in the Dockerfile to start Sysmon before executing the file:
Dockerfile
Copy code
ENTRYPOINT ["sysmon", "-accepteula", "-c", "/path/to/sysmon-config.xml", "&&", "python3", "sandbox.py"]
Step 6: Example of Running an Executable
Once the container is set up and the Python script is ready, you can run it with any file you want to analyze. For example, to execute malware.exe:

bash
Copy code
python3 sandbox.py /path/to/malware.exe
The container will:

Execute the file inside the isolated environment.
Log system activity if Sysmon is installed and configured.
Generate a report (you can further extend the script to generate logs or reports).
Key Points:
Isolation: The file is executed inside a Docker container, ensuring no interaction with your host system.
Monitoring: You can configure monitoring tools like Sysmon to capture events such as file changes, process creations, and network activity.
Logging: You can enhance the script to log system events or send the logs to a file for later analysis.
